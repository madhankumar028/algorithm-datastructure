If all the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order, we cannot calculate the water.


This problem is a very good example of stack application.
Here, we'll keep on pushing heights (array indices) on the stack.

For every height to be pushed:

If it is lesser than stack top, push it.

Else, pop a height from stack,

If stack becomes empty, push current height 
        (it would mean that all tower before this are of height lesser than this,
        hence no water will be collected).

Else, add the water collected between current tower and stack top tower.

Keep on popping until either stack become empty or stack top becomes greater than current height.

(If stack didn't become empty, we might have added extra water between stack top
and current tower of the amount equal to multiplication of difference in heights of these two
and their horizontal separation. So, we'll have to subtract it.)
